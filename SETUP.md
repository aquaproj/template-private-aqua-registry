# Set up

## Create a repository using the template repository

https://github.com/aquaproj/template-private-aqua-registry

Replace the following place holders.

* `<REGISTRY_NAME>`
* `<REPO_OWNER>`
* `<REPO_NAME>`

## CI

To test the registry in CI, GitHub Access Token is required to access private repositories.

We recommend to create GitHub App and install it to private repositories.
You can also use GitHub Personal Access Token instead of GitHub App.

## Renovate

You can test the tool update in CI using Renovate.
Please install Renovate in repositories.
